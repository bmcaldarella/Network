CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 4 
This project was created to fulfill the requirements of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, specifically Project 4. To run this program, follow these steps:

In your terminal, navigate to the "project4" directory.
Run the command python manage.py makemigrations network to create migrations for the network app.
Run the command python manage.py migrate to apply the migrations to your database.
I have utilized Django (Python), HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to complete the implementation of a social network. The requirements for this project are as follows:

⚈ New Post: Users should be able to create a new text-based post by entering text into a textarea and submitting it.
⚈ All Posts: The "All Posts" link in the navigation bar should display all posts from all users, with the most recent posts shown first.
Each post should include the username of the poster, the post content, the date and time of creation, and the number of likes.
⚈ Profile Page: Clicking on a username should load that user's profile page, which displays the number of followers and the number of people that the user follows. It should also display all posts by that user in reverse chronological order.
The profile page should have a "Follow" or "Unfollow" button for other signed-in users to toggle their follow status for that user's posts. Users cannot follow themselves.
⚈ Following: The "Following" link in the navigation bar should display posts made by users that the current user follows. This page should behave similarly to the "All Posts" page but with a limited set of posts.
⚈ Pagination: Display posts in sets of 10 per page. Provide "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation between pages.
⚈ Edit Post: Users can click an "Edit" button or link on their own posts to edit the content without reloading the entire page. Ensure that users cannot edit posts by other users.
⚈ "Like" and "Unlike": Users should be able to toggle the "like" status of a post without reloading the entire page. Use JavaScript to asynchronously update the like count.
